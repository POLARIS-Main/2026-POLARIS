# Control Systems Planning

## High-Level Overview
- Sensors to monitor [inputs, like weight, position, or user commands].
- Actuators/motors to perform [the mechanical task from the challenge].
- Microcontroller/CPU: [list if known — Arduino, Pi, custom PCB].

## Planned Software
- Control loops (PID, state machine, or FOC if using BLDCs).
- Communication bus (CAN, I²C, SPI, or serial).

## Testing Approach
- Simulation first (if applicable).
- Hardware-in-the-loop later.
